# BREAD With Express

## Okay, so you've written a bunch of Javascript... How's somebody going to use it?

  So you have a bunch of interesting Javascript behavior. That's great! But you don't have an app yet: There must be some way for the outside world to interact with it, without modifying your source code, in order for it to be an application. That means you need:

  a) A plan for getting information in
  b) A plan for getting information out

  **Analogy: Command line interfaces**

  One interface that you've learned about is the command line: A user (human or machine) can use your program by passing arguments after the filename. They never have to read your code: They simply learn what arguments can be passed in to achieve what effect, and use the program productively.

  Do you have a plan for:

  * Getting information in? **Yes!** The command line arguments in `process.argv`
  * Getting information out? **Yes!** The terminal output (STDOUT, or standard out)

  **HTTP interfaces**

  An HTTP interface is similar: You can set up a server to listen for HTTP requests, then using HTTP endpoints (URLs), a human or machine user can specify what they want via an HTTP request (instead of, for example, a terminal command). Then, the server can send back a response: A web page, some data, or an instruction of some sort (e.g. to redirect to another endpoint).

    Do you have a plan for:

  * Getting information in? **Yes!** The URL itself, and any data sent along with the HTTP request
  * Getting information out? **Yes!** The HTTP response

## Usually you want your apps to do BREAD stuff to Resources.

  ### So what's BREAD?

  B - Browse - Show some representation of a **collection**
  R - Read - Show some representation of a specific **entry** in a collection
  E - Edit - Modify a specific **entry** in a collection
  A - Add - Create a new entry in a **collection**
  D - Delete - Remove a specific **entry** from a collection

  ### What's a resource?

  Your resources tend to be the "nouns" in your app: You might think of them as different variations on the concept of "Users" (representations of people/agents) and "Posts" (things that Users create and interact with). Although that's a vast simplification, it has surprisingly broad explanatory power: Many things are just a type of Post:

  * Pin - Post, but it's an image
  * Gram - Post, but it's an image
  * Classified ad - Post, specifically for buying/selling/dating/etc. something
  * Tweet - Post, but only 280 characters (or something)
  * Article, message, etc.: Many things map onto this "post" concept straightforwardly

  What would it mean to do BREAD stuff to these things? Can you browse classifieds? What about read one? Edit, add, delete? Are there any actions that you might want to take that don't fit into one of those categories?

  ### REST: Doing BREAD stuff to resources

  So given that many apps can be thought of as simply combining two well-known patterns (i.e. Doing BREAD stuff to Resources), we can often apply one common routing convention to do most of our routing (using a `users` resource as an example):

  Browse - `GET /users`
  Read   - `GET /users/:id`
  Edit   - `POST /users/:id`
  Add    - `POST /users`
  Delete - `POST /users/:id/delete` (or `DELETE /users/:id` if available)
